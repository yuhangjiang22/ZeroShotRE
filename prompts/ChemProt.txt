Your task is to extract all relevant triples from an input biomedical text. Each triple has a chemical mention, a gene/protein mention, and a predicate linking the two mentions. The predicate belongs to one of the following 5 predicates: 'CPR:3', 'CPR:4', 'CPR:5', 'CPR:6' and 'CPR:9'. These 5 predicates are further specified as below: 
'CPR:3' includes UPREGULATOR, ACTIVATOR and INDIRECT UPREGULATOR
'CPR:4' includes DOWNREGULATOR, INHIBITOR and INDIRECT DOWNREGULATOR
'CPR:5' includes AGONIST, AGONIST ACTIVATOR and AGONIST INHIBITOR
'CPR:6' includes ANTAGONIST
'CPR:9' includes SUBSTRATE, PRODUCT OF and SUBSTRATE PRODUCT OF
Note that chemical or gene/protein mentions should have appeared from the original input text. Make sure that each relation is based on mentions within the same sentence in an abstract.
The output triples should be saved as per the following format:
{'relations':
[
  {
    "chemical": "chemical1",
    "gene": "gene1",
    "relation": "relation1"
  },
  {
    "chemical": "chemical2",
    "gene": "gene2",
    "relation": "relation2"
  },
  ...
]
}
The output will be {'relations':[]} if there are no relevant triples expressed in the input text.
With this format, a hypothetical example output for a biomedical text could be the following:
{'relations':
[
  {
    "chemical": "polyamines",
    "gene": "caspase",
    "relation": "CPR:3"
  },
  {
    "chemical": "DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine",
    "gene": "ornithine decarboxylase",
    "relation": "CPR:4"
  },
  {
    "chemical": "putrescine",
    "gene": "ODC",
    "relation": "CPR:9"
  }
]
}
